first of all keep the theme in the code. keep the Home, Predefined Casts, Custom, etc Tabs the same but add a Custom Season Tab to it then
I want a page where I can make a custom franchise like this
CUSTOM DRAG RACE - TITLE

MAKE A FRANCHISE (LIKE DRAG RACE USA, DRAG RACE PHILIPPINES) THEN AFTER MAKING A FRANCHISE, ENTER FRANCHISE NAME
THEN AFTER THAT MAKE A SEASON SO IT MAKES SEASON 1
THEN CHOOSE SEASON 1 CASTS
THEN CHOOSE FORMAT
CHOOSE FINALE
CHOOSE RETURN FORMAT
ETC
THEN SAVE (SO I CAN SIMULATE IT WHEN OR WHEREVER I WANT)

SO IT SHOWS

MAKE A FRANCHISE
DRAG RACE CUSTOM (FRANCHISE NAME)
S1 (AN ADD SEASON BUTTON WITH SAME FUNCTION)

THEN IF I MAKE ANOTHER FRANCHISE AND NAME ID DRAG RACE AI IT WILL BECOME LIKE
DRAG RACE CUSTOM | DRAG RACE AI

----------
after making franchise etc.  I want it to be like the custom franchises to be in tabs, like

DRAG RACE CUSTOM | DRAG RACE AI | REB'S UNIVERSE | KHLOE'S DRAG RACE (something like that 7 tabs per line)

then once I click for example I click Drag Race AI
then it shows the Season(s) that I made
